### Quick save

You can quick save your game when you focus this application by selecting the middle buttons in the
left menu. If you hit the keystroke combination of `ctr + s` on windows or `cmd + s` on mac, it
will trigger the quick save.

### Pre-manual save

If you want to create a specific game that you can name just fill the text field with something
that has meaning to you like `Before difficult boss`, `Before items drop`, `etc` and hit enter.

### Manual save

Now you have your manual save down there in a list. Here you have three buttons for
each save, first button `loads` that specific file, second `open save directory`
this is helpful to confirm your save is saved and the last button is to `delete` that save.
